# PowerBI-SuperStore-Analysis
This Repository is Created While I Practiced My BI Skills on a Super_Store Dataset.

I created a Dashboard on SuperStore Dataset visualizing their Sales & Profit. 
#### I used many visuals like Column Chart, Donut Chart, Drillthrough Donut Chart, Line Chart, Text Card, Number Card, Scrollers, Matrix, Simple Map, etc. 

Tool Used : Microsoft Power BI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)

The Dataset can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/juhi1994/superstore

Thank You.
